Project objectives:
Depict the chronology of events during the Great Patriotic War on the territory of Belarus. And also to reveal the heroism of the Belarusian people in this period.
When developing the program, the theory of programming was studied, according to the interaction of the program with the user. The program demonstrates the chronology of the events of the Second World War in the territories of Belarus. According to the entered data, the software displays the date in real time at which certain changes and events occur. The software allows you to see exactly how the process of the capture and liberation of Belarus went, and also provides the user with the opportunity to make their own corrections to the information.

When solving these problems, the following methods were used:
Analysis of sources, study of theory, creation of a computer program, practical work.
I propose to use the program for a visual demonstration of events in the territories of Belarus during the Second World War for students, employees, etc.
This software can be recommended to history teachers to demonstrate to their students the events in the territories of Belarus during the Second World War.
